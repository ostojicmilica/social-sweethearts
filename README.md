Please use PHP and MySQL (innoDB) as database. Make sure to implement a clean, well-structured and high-performance database scheme
The user should connect/login with Facebook (logout accordingly) The user data should be saved in the MySQL database.
The Facebook app should simply provide the following output: the name and profile picture of the logged-in user
The token, which will be stored for the user in the database, should be a long living access token
If the user removes the Facebook app, the user shall be marked as "is_active = false" in the database (Note: Facebook deauth callback)
Please be efficient when writing your code and commit your code in a github.com repository. Pay attention to clean commits
